# signUpForm

The signUpForm App collects the user's name, email, password, and password confirmation. 
When the user clicks the Save button, the app will display a message containg the user's name and welcome them to the app.

The app checks if all fields have information in them. If one doesn't, the user will get an error telling them to put information in the field.
It will also ask the user to re-enter their password and then check if both passwords are the same. The user will receive an error if they are not.

Once all fields have been entered and the passwords are the same, the user will be welcomed into the app through a Toast message.
